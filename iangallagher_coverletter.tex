\makelettertitle

I realize that I am not graduating in 2022 (Instead Graduating in June of this year) and am not a Computer Science major as listed in the requirements of the summer internship position. However, I have completed coursework focusing on data structures and algorithms, as well as basic principles of systems engineering and object oriented programming, and my college mathematics curriculum has nurtured my creativity and adaptability when working with complex problems.\newline

As a member of the Cal Poly Cubesat Laboratory software team I have worked to expand, refactor, and document the lab's existing Linux code base. In doing so, I have become familiar with the Unix programming environment, including basic shell scripting, version control systems like git and svn, and the power of the Unix philosophy of composability. Due to the high turnover rate of student members, the lab has also impressed upon me the importance of test-driven development and writing quality code, with proper documentation. Most importantly, this experience demonstrates that I can pick up and apply new tools and technologies quickly so that I can begin contributing as soon as possible as an intern at Dataminr.\newline

I want to work at Dataminr because of the opportunity to build and integrate client facing code, and to develop full stack industry experience. Although not directly listed in the responsibilities in the job posting, I am also interested in learning and applying tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform for applications that benefit from container management systems. The Bozeman office location is also appealing to me due to its access to the plentiful outdoor activities in and around the Gallatin Valley. \newline
